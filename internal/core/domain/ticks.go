// This is internal models for core layer.
// These models are used by the core layer to communicate between different services.
// These models are not exposed to the outside world.
// Strictly speaking, mapping should be done between these models and the models/dtos of the outside world.
// BUT! For simplicity, we will use the same models for the core layer and outcoming ports.
// See dto package for the models that are exposed for outcoming ports.
